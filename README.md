Learning Rust from the official Rust book 

In Chapter three, created the following projects

* [Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius](https://github.com/BrooksPatton/fahrenheit-to-celsius-rust)
* [Nth fibonacci rust](https://github.com/BrooksPatton/nth_fibonacci_rust)

At the end of chapter 6

* [Refactoring the C to F project to use enums](https://github.com/BrooksPatton/fahrenheit-to-celsius-rust/tree/using_enums)

## Currently at

* [Implicit Deref Coercions with Functions and Methods](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch15-02-deref.html#implicit-deref-coercions-with-functions-and-methods)

## Questions to answer

* What does a panic! look like from a compiled app

## Documentation fixes for the book

```Then generate a new library crate named add-one:

$ cargo new add-one
     Created library `add-one` project
```

For creating a library, need the lib flag

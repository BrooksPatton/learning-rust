Learning Rust from the official Rust book 

In Chapter three, created the following projects

* [Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius](https://github.com/BrooksPatton/fahrenheit-to-celsius-rust)
* [Nth fibonacci rust](https://github.com/BrooksPatton/nth_fibonacci_rust)

At the end of chapter 6

* [Refactoring the C to F project to use enums](https://github.com/BrooksPatton/fahrenheit-to-celsius-rust/tree/using_enums)

## Currently at


* Convert strings to pig latin. The first consonant of each word is moved to the end of the word and “ay” is added, so “first” becomes “irst-fay.” Words that start with a vowel have “hay” added to the end instead (“apple” becomes “apple-hay”). Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!
* Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a company. For example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.
* Chapter 9

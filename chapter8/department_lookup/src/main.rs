// Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a company. For example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.

// {
//     engineering: ['sally', 'amir'],
//     sales: ['bob']
// }

// Add <name> to <department>
// Get employees
// Get employees from <department>
